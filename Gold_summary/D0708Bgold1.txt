['Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director.\nThe SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.\nAs early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.\nIn 1991 it started a classroom program "Teaching Tolerance" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers.\nIt also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.\nThe SPLC\'s most outstanding successes, however, have been in its civil lawsuits against hate groups.\nDees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.\nDescribed as "wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders," the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina.\nBut despite these judgments the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance have survived.\n', 'China, Cuba and the United States are countries trying to improve music and arts education in the public schools.\nDespite disagreement as to the importance of this instruction to other aspects of the students\' development, its value in its own right is accepted.\nIt is also generally agreed that much demands to be done.\nIn China music and drama weekends supplement the school curriculum, special schools train rural schoolteachers in music and the arts and schools are being equipped with necessary facilities for music and arts instruction.\nIn Cuba music education is emphasized but the instruments are old and in need of repair.\nIn the United States there is widespread recognition of damage done by 20-30 years of elimination or reduction of music and arts classes due to budget cuts or increased emphasis on core subjects to satisfy testing requirements.\nVarious approaches are being tried as remedies.\nU.S. Secretary of Education Riley has said, "...most American children are infrequently or never given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music, the arts or theater.\nThat\'s wrong".\nAcross the country efforts to compensate for cutbacks include: raising private funds; arranging assistance to the public schools from cultural, educational and non-profit organizations; development of digital techniques for music and the arts; offering free after-school and summer programs; introducing low-cost equipment; blending the arts and music into core subjects; and including music and arts as college admission requirements.\n', "Most predictions prior to introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999 were positive.\nBy early 1996 a majority of Europeans accepted the idea and France's Prime Minister was strongly supportive.\nBy 1997 most British commentary was favorable.\nIn Germany the Bundesbank predicted that private investors would profit.\nBank officials as far away as Zambia saw benefits.\nBy 1998 the Chinese government had officially welcomed coming of the euro and the European Central Bank President predicted that the euro would eventually rival the dollar.\nDesign of the euro note began in 1996.\nIn 1998 the test printing of banknotes began and Germany minted some euro coins.\nBy the end of the year Germany was still experimenting with euro coins but France was in full production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain.\nIn May 1998 two major banks began quoting prices in euros.\nIn October Bulgaria linked its currency, the lev, to the German mark, followed in December by fixing the value of the lev to the euro.\nIn September key euro indicators were offered daily on the internet and in October Thailand announced that it was considering use of the euro in its foreign reserves.\nIn November the Reserve Bank of India permitted bank transactions in euros followed in December by Romania's posting the euro in its rates of exchange.\nSmall independent countries such as Monaco still faced some currency problems as Jan. 1, 1999 approached, but special arrangements were in process by European Union authorities.\n", 'Amnesty International (AI) monitors human rights practices throughout the world issuing specific complaints and periodic reports on governments with records of such human rights abuses as torture of prisoners, slaughter of innocent civilians or political opponents, genocide, illegal detention or violence and repression against political opposition.\nIt has also provided legal assistance in some cases.\nThe Thailand office of AI gave a human rights award to three publications and two journalists in 1998.\nTargets of AI complaints claim the organization ignores efforts towards reform, exaggerates abuses by forces of law and order, interferes in internal affairs of sovereign states, supports opposition groups, and sows seeds of hatred against the government among the population.\nAI charged the government of Kenya in 1997 with police torture of suspects and footdragging on promised human rights reforms.\nThe Kenyan government complained that AI must be sensitive to national sovereignty and the human rights of killed police officers and accused AI of inciting Kenyans against the government.\nA 1998 AI report charged the Rwandan army with massacring hundreds of unarmed civilians.\nRwandan authorities countered that AI was "another hand of the insurgency" and a mouthpiece for the Hutu hardliners.\nAI charges of racist acts by the German police were thoroughly investigated by German state officials in what they termed an impartial review that found that the police were not racist as a whole.\nAI complaints against the Afghan Taliban in 1996 were deemed interference in the internal affairs of an Islamic state.\n', 'In June 1996 the Basque separatist group ETA declared a week-long cease-fire in its 27-year violent struggle for independence.\nETA demanded that the Spanish government change its policy of placing ETA prisoners in jails far outside Basque country.\nThe government called on ETA to give up its arms altogether.\nNothing came of the cease-fire.\nViolence by the ETA continued through 1997 and into 1998.\nIn June 1998 the political ally of ETA, Herri Batasuma (HB) demanded a negotiated solution to violence calling for Basque independence and improved conditions for ETA prisoners.\nThe Spanish Prime Minister ruled out negotiation with HB unless it distanced itself from ETA or ETA laid down its arms.\nIn September a coalition of Basque nationalists including HB signed the Lizarra Declaration calling on ETA to renounce violence.\nETA declared an open-ended cease-fire.\nIn November the Spanish government agreed to preliminary talks with ETA but would only negotiate terms for ETA to surrender its weapons and the fate of more than 500 ETA prisoners.\nIt offered to transfer some prisoners to Basque country if ETA renounced violence for good.\nAn ETA spokesman said transfer of all prisoners would be a step towards peace talks.\nSpain offered to move 21 prisoners closer to Basque country but insisted on an end to violence.\nA single round of talks ended in stalemate and the truce ended in December 1999.\nBy September 2000 twelve more ETA-related killings were recorded and French authorities had arrested the Chief of ETA.\n', 'In 1990 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi\'s National League for Democracy won an 82% parliamentary majority in Myanmar (formerly Burma).\nSince then, the State Law and Order Restoration Council that seized power in 1988 and commits widespread ethnic cleansing and rape, has prevented Parliament from convening.\nIn January 1997 Suu Kyi was besieged in her van for 9 days by government thugs, to prevent her meeting elected lawmakers.\nBy September 1998 the SLORC had arrested 194 lawmakers-elect to prevent Parliament convening by or after NLD\'s Aug 21, 1998 deadline.\nIn 1998 the SLORC threatened 71-year old NLD Vice Chairman, Tin Oo, with re-imprisonment for continued political activities "violating" his parole.\nIn the World Trade Organization Europe and Japan challenged a US law banning government agencies from trading with anyone trading with Myanmar.\nMyanmar banned British officials after being pressured about meeting with Suu Kyi.\nThe EU restricted arms and non-humanitarian aid to Myanmar.\nThe US and EU countries boycotted an international heroin conference in heroin rife Myanmar.\nIn 1999 17 armed groups "exchanged arms for peace" with Myanmar\'s military government.\nMyanmar demanded Thailand control border refugee camps harboring foreign-sponsored military and "terrorist" training.\nThe Myanmar embassy in Bangkok was seized by Myanmar rebels.\nIn 2000 the US agreed to resettle 600 Burmese refugees.\nThe US denied anti-drug certification to Burma.\nThe Labor Department reported that Myanmar forces adult and child labor.\nSuu Kyi received Dublin\'s "Freedom of the City" award in absentia, as did pop band U2.\n', 'In 1987 Turkey applied for membership in the European Union.\nIn early 1997 the EU deferred considering EU membership for Turkey, some saying Turkey is an Asian nation, not European, despite U.S. endorsement of EU membership for Turkey as a European country.\nBy March 1997 the EU stated Turkey has a "European future".\nIn December 1997 the EU omitted Turkey from its accessions list, due to Turkey\'s "poor human rights and bad relations with Greece".\nIn May 1998 the German Foreign Minister said Turkey\'s human rights situation, conflict with Kurds, economic problems and poor relations with Greece will keep Turkey out of the EU "in foreseeable future".\nIn June 1998 the Greek Prime Minister declared no intention of preventing Turkey\'s accession, if its human rights improve.\nIn November 1998 an EU accession report omitted Turkey, but said Turkey is a "candidate country".\nConsidering Turkish membership was delayed because of persistent human rights violations, no civilian control over the military and incompatibility with EU legal and administrative standards.\nIn September 1999 Italy urged the EU to accept Turkey as a "candidate of the union" as long as Turkey moves closer to Europe on human rights, because delay puts Turkey\'s economy at risk.\nIn December 1999 Turkey joined the accession list, but the EU deferred negotiations, pushing Turkey\'s accession beyond 2005, due to Turkey\'s poor human rights record.\nIn January 2000 Turkey deferred execution of Kurdish leader Abdulla Ocalan, easing European concerns about Turkey\'s human rights record and the death penalty.\n', 'Potable water shortages are common in many countries of Asia and Africa and have also occurred on the island of Cyprus and in Mexico.\nThe cause is usually a chronic condition of limited sources of potable water to serve populated areas aggravated by equipment failures, obsolete or inadequate distribution systems, drought and inefficient, wasteful or absent water-management programs.\nDamaged or obsolete distribution systems present problems in Angola, Bangladesh, China, Cyprus and Lebanon.\nInadequate distribution systems are the crux of the problem in parts of China, Ethiopia, Iran, Bangladesh, Lebanon and Nepal.\nPeriods of drought have worsened the situation in The Philippines, Malaysia, Cyprus, Vietnam, Tanzania, Thailand, Pakistan, Rwanda, and Afghanistan.\nCyprus relies completely on rainfall and plans desalination plants to relieve the shortage.\nWaste, pollution and lack of an efficient water-management system are problems in South Africa, China, Lebanon and Mexico.\nLebanon relies on pumping stations to bring water from the coast to rural areas but is afflicted by leaky pipes and a system less efficient than reliance on dams and gravity.\nNepal presents an unusual case in having rich sources of water but no system to tap this resource and bring its treasure to the people even in its capital of Katmandu.\nThe biggest problem is providing limited resources of water to growing urban areas where the need is the greatest and problems of waste and pollution are the most severe.\n']
