['Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director.\nThe SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.\nAs early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.\nIn 1991 it started a classroom program "Teaching Tolerance" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers.\nIt also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.\nThe SPLC\'s most outstanding successes, however, have been in its civil lawsuits against hate groups.\nDees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.\nDescribed as "wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders," the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina.\nBut despite these judgments the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance have survived.\n', 'China, Cuba and the United States are countries trying to improve music and arts education in the public schools.\nDespite disagreement as to the importance of this instruction to other aspects of the students\' development, its value in its own right is accepted.\nIt is also generally agreed that much demands to be done.\nIn China music and drama weekends supplement the school curriculum, special schools train rural schoolteachers in music and the arts and schools are being equipped with necessary facilities for music and arts instruction.\nIn Cuba music education is emphasized but the instruments are old and in need of repair.\nIn the United States there is widespread recognition of damage done by 20-30 years of elimination or reduction of music and arts classes due to budget cuts or increased emphasis on core subjects to satisfy testing requirements.\nVarious approaches are being tried as remedies.\nU.S. Secretary of Education Riley has said, "...most American children are infrequently or never given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music, the arts or theater.\nThat\'s wrong".\nAcross the country efforts to compensate for cutbacks include: raising private funds; arranging assistance to the public schools from cultural, educational and non-profit organizations; development of digital techniques for music and the arts; offering free after-school and summer programs; introducing low-cost equipment; blending the arts and music into core subjects; and including music and arts as college admission requirements.\n', "Most predictions prior to introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999 were positive.\nBy early 1996 a majority of Europeans accepted the idea and France's Prime Minister was strongly supportive.\nBy 1997 most British commentary was favorable.\nIn Germany the Bundesbank predicted that private investors would profit.\nBank officials as far away as Zambia saw benefits.\nBy 1998 the Chinese government had officially welcomed coming of the euro and the European Central Bank President predicted that the euro would eventually rival the dollar.\nDesign of the euro note began in 1996.\nIn 1998 the test printing of banknotes began and Germany minted some euro coins.\nBy the end of the year Germany was still experimenting with euro coins but France was in full production followed by Finland, Belgium and Spain.\nIn May 1998 two major banks began quoting prices in euros.\nIn October Bulgaria linked its currency, the lev, to the German mark, followed in December by fixing the value of the lev to the euro.\nIn September key euro indicators were offered daily on the internet and in October Thailand announced that it was considering use of the euro in its foreign reserves.\nIn November the Reserve Bank of India permitted bank transactions in euros followed in December by Romania's posting the euro in its rates of exchange.\nSmall independent countries such as Monaco still faced some currency problems as Jan. 1, 1999 approached, but special arrangements were in process by European Union authorities.\n"]
