The supply of water in the Angolan capital Luanda could not be resumed within at least eight days , the Luanda provincial governor Justino Fernandes said here today .   Fernandes was speaking to the press on the water shortage problem in Luanda .   Fernandes said that the government was short of money to buy materials so a period of time was needed to completely get rid of water shortage in the Angolan capital .   It is the 10th day today that water supply in Luanda has suspended .   Such a suspension of water supply resulted from the cut-off of power supply to the water plant in the suburbs as large rain fell down two high-voltage power supply towers .   The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply with no sign of immediate improvement .   Sources from the city 's Water and Sewerage Authority ( WASA ) said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million liters through 205 deep tube-wells , well short of the daily demand of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka .   Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for WASA to meet the demand .   They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage .
