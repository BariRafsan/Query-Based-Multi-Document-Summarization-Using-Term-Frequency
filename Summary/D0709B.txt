Gwyneth Paltrow of `` Shakespeare In Love '' and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture acting , and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy actor at the Golden Globes .   Ed Harris of `` The Truman Show '' and Lynn Redgrave of `` Gods and Monsters '' won motion picture supporting actor honors .   The Golden Globes honorees lived up to the irreverence for which the show has become known , but Fox 's acceptance speech added a touching note .   The `` Spin City '' star , who has been diagnosed with Parkinson 's disease , thanked his doctors , including one he said had opened up his brain .   `` We 're so lucky to do what we do ... and just take every day and enjoy it , '' Fox said .   Paltrow played the upper-crust lady who becomes the lover and muse of William Shakespeare in `` Shakespeare in Love , '' which also won best screenplay .   In `` Little Voice , '' Caine played a sleazy agent who tries to turn a meek woman with powerful musical gift for show tunes into a star .   `` Oh , what a shock , '' Caine said as he picked up his honor .   `` My career must be slipping .   This is the first time I 've been available to pick up an award . ''   `` Shakespeare in Love '' and `` The Truman Show '' were the leading movie nominees , with six apiece .   `` Saving Private Ryan '' followed with five .   `` Bulworth , '' `` Elizabeth , '' `` Gods and Monsters '' and `` Little Voice '' had three nominations apiece .   The awards , broadcast from a hotel ballroom by NBC , were plagued by problems with sound cutting out and the picture freezing momentarily .   Harris set the tone for the notoriously freewheeling awards show by coming on stage with a toothpick in Gwyneth Paltrow 's mouth , saying , `` Oh man , I just got through eating dinner . ''   Backstage he noted that `` The Truman Show '' came out in the summer , long before studios traditionally roll out their award-worthy product .   `` I 'm glad that people did n't forget about it , '' he said .   Redgrave , who played the crusty but loving maid to an aging horror director in `` Gods and Monsters , '' said , `` It 's been 32 years since I stood one of these on a mantelpiece and it 's been crying out for a friend ever since . ''   In the television categories , Dylan McDermott of `` The Practice '' and Keri Russel of `` Felicity '' were named best actor and actress , respectively in television dramatic series .   Jenna Elfman won best actress in a TV musical or comedy series for `` Dharma and Greg . ''
